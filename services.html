          <h3>Kids Dentistry</h3>
          <p>
            The first tooth in a child erupts as early as in 6 months and they
            get the set of primary 'milk' teeth by the age of 4-5 years.
            <br />
            Parents ignore taking care of the teeth of their toddlers since they
            live in a belief that the milk teeth will eventually fall off.
            <br />
            However, it is important to consult a pediatric dentist near you as
            soon as your child's first tooth appears or when your child turns
            one to ensure good oral health of your kid.

          <h3>Dental Implants</h3>
          <p>
            Dental implants are easily the most popular and also the ideal
            solution, for replacing your missing tooth/teeth. They have
            definitely changed the course of dentistry in the last quarter of a
            century or so.
            <br />
            A dental implant is basically a titanium post which is surgically
            inserted into the jawbone beneath the gum line to work as a tooth
            root. Post insertion, an implantologist will attach a crown on top
            of the implant to ensure the appearance of a natural tooth.
            <br />
            Tooth Implants not only look and feel like your natural teeth but
            also function like them

          <h3>Wisdom Teeth Removal</h3>
          <p>
            Wisdom teeth often known as third molars are the last teeth to
            erupt. As per dentists worldwide, one usually gets them in late
            teens or early twenties.
            <br />
            However, even instances of eruption in late adulthood are common. If
            they erupt smoothly and without any interruption, then they can be
            proved as an asset. But the problem with third molars is that in
            case they do not erupt properly or are misaligned, they would need
            to be extracted. If they are poorly aligned, then they can damage
            the adjacent tooth.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>RCT</h3>
          <p>
            The outer portion or Crown of a tooth is a three-layered structure
            namely - Enamel, Dentin & Pulp. If the tooth decay is limited to the
            first two layers, it can be corrected with Filling/ Restoration.
            <br />
            In case the tooth decay reaches the third layer and causes
            inflammation or infection of pulp, an RCT or Endodontic Treatment is
            needed. A dentist at the nearest dental clinic should be consulted
            at the earliest in such cases.

          <h3>Braces & Aligners</h3>
          <p>
            Dental braces are appliances used to align or straighten the teeth.
            They do so by moving your teeth in the desired position. Being made
            of wires, brackets, and bands, they create the right push. <br />
            Apart from perfectly aligning the teeth, braces aid to correct the
            jaw positioning, improves speech & biting disorders, and is a major
            contributor in aesthetically enhancing your smile.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Fillings</h3>
          <p>
            Dental Filling is a treatment modality administered by a dentist to
            restore missing tooth structure which could have been a result of
            decay or trauma.
            <br />
            Decay makes the tooth hollow. Dental Filling helps in filling this
            gap and protect it from further decay.
            <br />
            A filling is also used to repair broken or cracked tooth and the
            teeth which wear off due to dental habits like teeth grinding, nail
            biting etc.
